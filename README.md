# SolarCoin Claiming API Examples

A few example programs to help understand the Claiming API, what data is required, and how to submit your claims as an Affiliate. These examples are written in Node, but feel free to port, extend, or generally hack away at them. These examples use Superagent, but any requests library capable of handling a REST API (i.e. all of them) will work.

### Installing

Just

```
npm install
```

then fill in your API username, token, and base URL you were given after you signed up as an Affiliate.

Then

```
node <desired_example.js>
```

to see the results of any example you like.
